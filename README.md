- 👋 Hi, I’m @CCBrenner
- 👀 I’m interested in learning full-stack development in search for my first programming job.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to publish my first website using GitHUb and Netlify. Later I plan on learning Django in-depth which hopefully forces 
      me to learn more about MySQL Lite a bit more.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything in particular at the moment as I am pretty lonely in my coding endeavors at the moment. I would be open 
      to new ideas and getting to know more people in the profession for sure.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at collynbrenner@gmail.com
