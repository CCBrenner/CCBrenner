Welcome to my GH profile! I code mostly with C#, F#, JS, Python and FE languages (& I will learn Rust). I am what they call a "junior" dev. I have worked on many solo projects (see repos below) and I have not worked as a software dev for a job (yet). I have experience writing software documentation. 

I am excited for the excellent future that awaits us, as we are those who will build the future. It is the dependency of the world on our creations that gives us great influence over the future's direction, and I approach this responsibility with great care and hope.

I love creating excellent tools that have excellent CX, & these depend on great technology engines as their support. Person-person relationships are just as (if not more) important as data structures-data structure relationships. We must take care concerning person-data structure relationships, especially with emerging, untested technology.

I believe evidence-based practice and concept-oriented learning are the way to go. Passing tests and zero compilation errors should always be evidence of correct functioning. Engineering starts with dependencies that are not dumb (five steps). Shared meaning > spoken words. 

You can IM me on 𝕏 or any of the other platforms here. I look forward to collaborating & being part of cooperative efforts to build tech that changes the future for the better, even if only in many small ways!
