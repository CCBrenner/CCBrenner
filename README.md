Full-stack developer, currently work Tier 2 support at BlueSky Medical Staffing Software. Looking to move into a QA or software development position. I have a computer science degree from TNU. I code mostly with C#, C/C++, Python, JS and sometimes F# (for a little FP flavoring). I also know a bit about Rust and Zig (I'm looking forward to Zig's maturity). Safe systems are the best (because they don't suffer from bugs) and so I see TDD (or BDD) as the best approach in nearly every case. Safe *languages are cool too (I'm looking at you, C++); it is important to bridge the skill gap in anything, but starting out with a steep language learning curve (unnecessarily verbose) that doesn't need to be there is not the coolest. I typically believe you only need one solution to do the job well, and there is no point in having additional options to make yourself seem more clever when it is at the expense of readability and/or practicality. It is still important that your tool is able to do all that you need it to do. A good language makes it easy for the developer to fall into the the right solution for their use case. It's important that developers enjoy developing (for the most part) or else they might hate doing it after some time and desire developing less and less (developers are people; psychology matters). Experience is the best informant, experienced people are great advisors, and debugging skills are the evidence of a seasoned developer. My preferred front-ends are Blazor or ReactJS. Backend for most things is ASP.NET. Extend your knowledge base everyday. Do something new and challenging that is useful on a regular basis. EF Core is very useful; I know SQL as well. I don't care about the tribalism of framework wars or paradigm tribes - they're traps for novice developers, of which I was a casualty for too long a time. Other than lack of tools needed to build the best future, the thing in highest demand and least supply is developer feedback from actual users that are able to describe techincally what they like and don't like about tools/systems and why. What makes this in high-demand is how developers treat other people when they interact with those who are providing feedback. If you hurt your feedback loop, you eventually no longer have an effective feedback loop. Everyone should always be returning back to the question "Why?" in everything they do to stick close to the meaningfulness of living. There is much meaning in building new things because it indicates a hope and investment in making the future the best it can be. The future is better when we build together.
