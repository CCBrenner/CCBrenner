Welcome! I'm Collyn Brenner and I am a full-stack developer. C# is my primary. I work mostly in .NET Core and I have significant experience using Blazor razor components. Other languages I know include Python, JS, F#, HTML & CSS (and I'm willing to learn others; I have particular interest in C++ and Rust also). I am a junior developer with a desire to make things happen. My programming experience involves mostly my own solo projects and I look forward to developing for a company and on a team of developers one day. I have more than 2 years of experience working technical support at a software company (BlueSky, healthcare staffing). This job has given me significant experience writing high-quality software documentation (something that is undervalued by many developers). I have a degree in computer science from Trevecca Nazarene University.

The future excites me and I want to build it. Just like Jesus said those who are least now will become the greatest, it is those who go low who will find themselves in a high position. Engineers build and maintain the dependencies that others adopt, trust, and rely on, so I see servanthood as a high position. I approach the responsibility of the future with great care and hope.

I find the high accessibility of mobile apps highly impactful (and therefore worthwhile) and the quality of video game programming inspiring. I see the potential of feedback loops as a huge and often-missed opportunity and difficult things as a means for putting distance between yourself and competitors. I see success as primarily influenced by self, and I view one's own mistakes - not other people - as the major roadblocks to one's own success. I see technological advancement as innevitable yet fueled by hard working, devoted people and game theory as the answer that shows unified, cooperative, coordinated effort that is substantially intrinsically motivated produces the best results.

I have a deep desire for excellence in everything I do, especially for creating great user experiences (CX). I never forget that no matter what, it is people who build and people who use software tools, and so how people are treated matters quite a bit to me; people are why anything means anything. Technology serves people. Relationships between people matter just as much as (and perhaps much more than) any relationship between data stuctures. People rely on us to create a safe future during uncertain technological advances.

I rely on evidence-based practice and black-box learning as my approach. Passing tests are the proof that shows a program or process works. If it doesn't work, then the tests need attention (adding, modifying or as signposts for locating incorrect code; TDD saves a lot of time in the long-term). I subscribe to Elon Musk's 5 steps of innovation, the first step being making your requirements less dumb.
